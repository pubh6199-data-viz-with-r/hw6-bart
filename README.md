# Final Project: Clinic Visits with Complete Tobacco History

Authors: Ashlan Jackson & Sora Ely  
Course: PUBH 6199 – Visualizing Data with R  
Date: June 26, 2025


## 🔍 Project Overview

This pilot project aimed to increase tobacco history completeness at GW clinic visits. Therefore, our graphs are broken down by pilot versus non-pilot specialties/staff, or by individual specialties/staff, and can be viewed on a weekly or monthly interval. This is data that will be used to review lung cancer screening and to hopefully increase screening rates. 


## 📊 Final Write-up

The final write-up, including code and interpretation of the visualizations, is available here:

## 🛠 How to Run the Code

### To render the write-up:

1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio.
2. Open `index.qmd`.
3. Click **Render**. The updated html will be saved in the `docs/` folder.

### To run the Shiny app (if applicable):

1. Open the `shiny-app` folder.
2. Open the `app.R` file in RStudio.
3. Click "Run App" in the top right corner of the script editor.

```r
setwd("shiny-app") # Set working directory to shiny app folder
shiny::runApp("shiny-app")
```

> ⚠️ Make sure any necessary data files are in `shiny-app/app-data/`.

## ✅ To-Do or Known Issues

We hope to add a working app to the weekly and monthly static graphs.

We also plan to later add additional interactive visualizations for individual specialties & departments to the dashboard.
Minor additional visual refinements also planned.# Ashlan_Jackson
