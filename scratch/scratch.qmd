## Prototype V1

[requirements]{.underline}{.smallcaps}

- [x] Data scraping and cleaning complete (using real world datasets, do not use R built-in data)

- [ ] At least one visualization already implemented, and draft for 2-3 more visualizations\
      -- Sora & Ashlan by Tues 06:00\
      - Sora = bar graph\
      - Ashlan = 1st line graph\

- [ ] If choosing R shiny app, rough webpage design and structure has to be done and implemented (placeholders for visualizations)\
      -- Sora to do Tues day before 16:00 1:1 meeting

~~- [ ] If choosing the other two options, clear outline and storytelling flow of the visualizations~~

      -- Ashlan to make a draft by Tues 16:00 1:1 meeting\
      -- Sora to finalize Wed\

## Final data visualization product

Choose one from the following three options:

~~1. Same Question, Different Audiences (3 static charts): Create three visualizations that answer the same question, each designed for a different audience (e.g., general public, policy makers, technical experts).~~

~~2. Same Data, Different Questions (3 static charts): Use the same dataset to answer three different but related questions, each with its own focused visualization.~~

**3. Interactive Dashboard (1 app with 3 components): Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with shiny, plotly, or similar tools) that includes at least three visual components for exploring your data dynamically.**

- [ ] 2nd line graph
      -- Ashlan by Tues night / Wed 06:00

- [ ] final webpage design & merging the graphs/Shiny apps
      -- Sora on Wed
