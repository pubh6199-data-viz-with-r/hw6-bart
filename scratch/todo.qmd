# to-do & requirements

## Prototype V1

[requirements]{.underline}

- [x] Data scraping and cleaning complete (using real world datasets, do not use R built-in data)

- [x] At least one visualization already implemented, and draft for 2-3 more visualizations\
      -- Sora & Ashlan by Tues 06:00\
      [x] @SORA = bar graph\
      [x] @ASHLAN = 1st line graph\

- [x] If choosing R shiny app, rough webpage design and structure has to be done and implemented (placeholders for visualizations)\
      -- @SORA to do Tues day before 16:00 1:1 meeting

## Final data visualization product

Choose one from the following three options:

~~1. Same Question, Different Audiences (3 static charts): Create three visualizations that answer the same question, each designed for a different audience (e.g., general public, policy makers, technical experts).~~

~~2. Same Data, Different Questions (3 static charts): Use the same dataset to answer three different but related questions, each with its own focused visualization.~~

**3. Interactive Dashboard (1 app with 3 components): Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with shiny, plotly, or similar tools) that includes at least three visual components for exploring your data dynamically.**

[requirements]{.underline}

- **index.qmd**\
  "Accompanying your visualizations, you should also include a write-up around 500-1000 words that consists of an introduction, research questions, data sources, data wrangling, data visualizations, findings, and conclusion."\
    [ ] @ASHLAN: "write-up": introduction, data wrangling, data visualizations (Visualization 1, Visualization 2), references
    [ ] @SORA = "write-up": research questions, data sources, data visualizations (Shiny dashboard), interpretation, limitations, conclusion
      
- [ ] A README.md file in your GitHub repo that describes your project, how to view it, and any dependencies\
      -- @ASHLAN\

- [ ] 2nd line graph\
      -- @ASHLAN\

- [ ] final dashboard/Shiny app\
      -- @SORA on Wed\

- [ ] publish the Shiny app to Shiny.io\
      -- @SORA on Wed\
    
- [ ] final push of the git project\
      -- @TBD

## Final project presentation

- 10 minutes presentation
  - no slides :)

[@SORA]{.underline}\
- [ ] What questions do you set out to answer with your visualizations? Why are they important?\
- [ ] Your data source and why they are chosen to answer your questions\
- [ ] Your intended audience\
[@ASHLAN]{.underline}\
- [ ] Two to three visualization design choices and how they help tell your story\
- [ ] Two to three takeaways from your visualizations that your audience should remember\
- [ ] Live demo of your visualizations (if applicable)\
